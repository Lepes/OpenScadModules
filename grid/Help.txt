Purpose: 
	- Create a coloured grid to easy place objects visually on Open Scad
	- Scale numbers are printed optionally
	- Pivot Axes are printe optionally

How to use:
	- Copy all files into Open Scad Library folder, it is usually located in "Documents\OpenSCAD\libraries"
	- Open a new Open Scad file and type: 
		include  <testgridXY.scad>
  - Done. All files called testgrid__ are prepared to show the grid and axes.


  
Grid.scad:
  - implemented routines:
			- showGridX(): Show a grid on the axis/axes
			- showGridY()
			- showGridZ()
			- showGridXY()
			- showGridXZ()
			- showGridYZ()
			- showAxes(): Show Pivot axes on the coordenates origin.
			- showScaleX(): Show Scale numbers of each line of the grid
			- showScaleY()
			- showScaleZ()

  - Parameters of those functions:
	 All functions excepts showAxes() have the following parameters:
	 		smallStep  //distance from a thick line to another one
			bigStep		// distance from a big line to another one.
			gridSize	// grid size units (on the positive axis, the negative will be display as well)
			gridLine	// thickness of the thick lines. 

			*showAxes() only use the two last parameters.
			
Design: 
	- Each line is a long cube on one Axis.
	- It is place bellow the Axis (for example GridXY is drawn on negative Z coordenate, so it doesn't disturb when you create pieces on XY plane)
	- There are two kind of lines:
    - small: thick lines printed every smallStep
	- big: double size of small lines, printed every bigSteps
